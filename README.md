**Roaming - A Travel Journal App**
==================================

Roaming is a **visual storytelling app** that encourages users to capture raw, aesthetic moments and create a **digital footprint** of their experiences. Unlike traditional photo-sharing platforms that emphasize selfies and social engagement, Roaming is designed to document **places, landscapes, cityscapes, and nature**, allowing users to tell stories through their surroundings rather than themselves.

Whether it's a **bustling city skyline, a quiet morning in nature, or a unique architectural detail**, Roaming helps users focus on **capturing the world around them** rather than posing for the camera. By taking and uploading photos that showcase **atmosphere, environment, and emotion**, users build a **personal visual diary** that reflects the places they've been and the moments they've witnessed.

With **no likes, no follower counts, and no pressure**, Roaming is an invitation to **slow down** and appreciate the **beauty in everyday life---one photo at a time**.
